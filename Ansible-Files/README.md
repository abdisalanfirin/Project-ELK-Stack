## Automated ELK Stack Deployment

The files in this repository were used to configure the network depicted below.

![ELK-STACK-Diagram](./Images/ELK-STACK.PNG)

These files been tested and verify and used to generate a live ELK Stack deployment within Azure. They can also be used to either recreate the entire deployment pictured above. And also maybe select portions of the yml files may be used to install only certain pieces of it, such as Filebeat.

dvwa-playbook.yml used to install DVWA Webservers.

elk-playbook.yml used to install ELK Stack Server.

filebeat-config.yml Filebeat service configuration modified and copied to the webservers as filebeat.yml.

### Description of the Topology

The main purpose of this network is to expose a load-balanced and monitored instance of DVWA, the D*mn Vulnerable Web Application.

Load balancing ensures the web application is available across multiple web application servers restricting unwanted or unecessary access to the Internet. A Load Balancers also may mitigate some DoS attacks as it can balance the load across many web application servers. Typically load balancers include a health probe to check all of the servers in its pool are functioning appropriately before sending traffic to them or it will stop sending traffic to missing or poor performing servers providing better uptime for the web application.

A Jump Box is similar to a gateway router as it becomes a single point of a protected network exposed to the public network as it sits in front of the other machines that are not exposed to the Internet. To further control access only specified IP addresses and port 22 are allowed access to the Jump Box. To avoid the username and password weakness of SSH we used asynchronous encryption keys to ensure a higher degree of protection than usernames and passwords.

Integrating an ELK server allows users to easily monitor the vulnerable VMs for changes to the machine metrics and system logs.

Filebeat is used to capture system logs or file locations you specify then sending data to the ELK Server for indexing and review.

Metricbeat is used to capture machine metrics on Linux, Windows, and Mac hosts then forwarding to the ELK Server to track system level CPU usage, memory, file system, disk I/O, and network I/O metricbeat

The configuration details of each machine may be found below.

### Elk Configuration

Ansible was used to automate configuration of the ELK machine. No configuration was performed manually, which is advantageous because...
- _TODO: What is the main advantage of automating configuration with Ansible?_

### Answer
its simplifys deployment from the central location that can be used to expand or redeploy the ELK Stack just by running an Ansible playbooks.

The playbook implements the following tasks:
- _TODO: In 3-5 bullets, explain the steps of the ELK installation play. E.g., install Docker; download image; etc._

### Answer

- The playbook implements the following tasks:
- First I Install Docker, Python, and the Docker Module.
- Then I Configure the ELK Server memory.
- After that I Download Docker ELK Container and configure it.

The following screenshot displays the result of running `docker ps` after successfully configuring the ELK instance.

### Target Machines & Beats
This ELK server is configured to monitor the following machines:
## Answer

- **10.0.0.5**
- **10.0.0.6**
- **10.0.0.7**

I have installed the following Beats on these machines:
## Answer

- **Filebeat**
- **Metricbeat**

These Beats allow us to collect the following information from each machine:
## Answer

- System log and application log details which include Web Traffic is gathered by Filebeat.
- CPU, Memory, Disk, Network, and other top-like statics are gathered with Metricbeat.

### Using the Playbook
In order to use the playbook, I will need to have an Ansible control node already configured, Ansible control node on the jump box  

SSH into the control node and follow the steps below:
- Copy the configuration file to the /etc/ansible/files/ to make configuration changes.
- Update the /etc/ansible/hosts file to include the targeted machine or machines.
- Create the <role>-playbook.yml file with the required tasks to be run by ansible-playbook.
- Run the playbook then navigate to the ELK Server Kibana data installation page to check the Module status that the installation worked as expected.

then Answer the following questions to fill in the blanks:_
- _Which file is the playbook? Where do you copy it?_
Which file do you update to make Ansible run the playbook on a specific machine? How do I specify which machine to install the ELK server on versus which to install Filebeat on?

### Answers

- Ansible playbook files were <role>-playbook.yml files located on the Jump Server within the Ansible Docker container in the /etc/ansible/roles/ folder.

- To update specific machines we edited the /etc/ansible/hosts by ensuring the [header] element is not commented out with a # or needs to be created then the hostname/IP of the machines are added to the file for Ansible to target groups of machines.

- Navigating to <http://104.210.155.66/app/kibana> successfully ensures the ELK Server is running and is ready for use.

## Commands I used to install  ELK Stack, Filebeat, and Metricbeat

- first I Install the ELK Stack on the elk server.
- then Connected to the Jump Box and attach to the Ansible container
- SSH into the Jump-Box by using ssh sysadmin@137.135.107.66

- Locate the container name:

Azureuser@Jump-Box-Provisioner:~$ sudo docker container list -a
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                          COMMAND                  CREATED       STATUS                   PORTS     NAMES
34a0f498a3fc   cyberxsecurity/ansible         "/bin/sh -c /bin/basâ€¦"   2 weeks ago   Exited (0) 4 hours ago             festive_wiles

- Start the container:

Azureuser@Jump-Box-Provisioner:~$ sudo docker container start festive_wiles
root@56b542ca508c:~#

- Attach (connect) to the Ansible container: festive_wiles

Azureuser@Jump-Box-Provisioner:~$ sudo docker container attach festive_wiles
root@56b542ca508c:~#

### Update the Ansible hosts file and create yml playbook file

Add the ELK Server IP address to the Ansible /etc/ansible/hosts file creating an [elk] section with the IP address:

- Open hosts file:

root@56b542ca508c:~# nano /etc/ansible/hosts

Add the [elk] section followed by the ELK Server IP address:

[elk]

10.1.0.4

Create the Ansible playbook used to install and configure elk container on  ELK Server virtual machine.

- root@56b542ca508c:~# nano /etc/ansible/roles/elk-playbook.yml

ELK install and the configuration tasks can be seen in the elk-playbook.yml playbook to automate ELK Stack deployment.

Exit nano and save the playbook.

### Running the Playbook and testing the results

### Install the Filebeat on to the webserver virtual machines

First i Create the Filebeat Configuration File
Stay attached to the Ansible container on the Jump box.
then Install the ELK Stack on the elk server after that i  Connected to the Jump Box and attach to the Ansible container for steps to attach to the Ansible container.
then Copy filebeat-config.yml to the Ansible container.

root@56b542ca508c:/etc/ansible# curl https://gist.githubusercontent.com/slape/5cc350109583af6cbe577bbcc0710c93/raw/eca603b72586fbe148c11f9c87bf96a63cb25760/Filebeat > /etc/ansible/files/filebeat-config.yml

100 73112  100 73112    0     0   964k      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:--  964k

I Edit the Filebeat configuration file to send Beat traffic to the ELK Stack container running on the ELK Server.
root@56b542ca508c:/etc/ansible# nano -l /etc/ansible/files/filebeat-config.yml

- In order To send data to the ELK Server I hvae to add IP addressto the filebeat-config.yml.
Scroll to line #1105 and set the IP address of the ELK server leaving the port :9200 in place.
Note that the default credentials are elastic:changeme and should be changed to the proper username and password

- I should look like something like this

output.elasticsearch:
hosts: ["10.1.0.4:9200"]
username: "elastic"
password: "changeme"

After that I Scroll to line #1805 to replace the IP address with the ELK Server's IP Address and leaving the port :5601 in place.

- it should look like something like this

setup.kibana:
host: "10.1.0.4:5601"

### Filebeat Installation Playbook file

- Download the .deb file from artifacts.elastic.co.
- Install the .deb file using the dpkg command shown below:
- dpkg -i filebeat-7.6.1-amd64.deb
- Copy the Filebeat configuration file from the Ansible container to webservers.
- Used the Ansible module copy to copy the entire configuration file into the correct place.
- Run the filebeat modules enable system command.
- Run the filebeat setup command.
- Run the service filebeat start command.
- Enable the Filebeat service on boot.

Then I Build the playbook from the task overview using nano, Ansible, and Eleastic documentation.

root@56b542ca508c::~# nano /etc/ansible/roles/filebeat-playbook.yml

Filebeat install and configuration tasks will be  in the filebeat-playbook.yml playbook to automate the deployment of Filebeat.
